Docker Containers
=================

This first version of Isaac Lab Arena is designed to run inside a Docker container.


We provide two docker containers for Isaac Lab Arena:

- **Base**: Contains the Isaac Lab Arena code and all its dependencies.
- **Base + GR00T**: Additionally includes GR00T and its dependencies.

We include the two containers such that the user can choose between container with minimal
dependencies (**Base**) or container with all dependencies (**Base + GR00T**).

In order to start the containers run:

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Base

        :docker_run_default:

    .. tab:: Base + GR00T

        :docker_run_gr00t:



The run docker will build the container and then enter in interactive mode.

.. note::
    The container with all dependencies (**Base + GR00T**) is significantly larger than the container with minimal dependencies (**Base**),
    so it is recommended to use the **Base** container for development and the **Base + GR00T** container for GR00T policy post-training and evaluation.
    If you are not sure which container to use, we recommend using the **Base** container.
    If you want to use the **Base + GR00T** container for development, currently it is not supported to run on Blackwell GPUs, and DGX Spark.

Mounted Directories
-------------------

The run docker script will mount the following directories on the host machine to the container:

- **Datasets**: from host: ``$HOME/datasets`` to container: ``/datasets``
- **Models**: from host: ``$HOME/models`` to container: ``/models``
- **Evaluation**: from host: ``$HOME/eval`` to container: ``/eval``

In our examples, we download input datasets and pre-trained models.
It is useful to download these to a folder mapped on the host machine to avoid re-downloading
between restarts of the container.
These directories are configurable through argument to the run docker script.

For a full list of arguments see the ``run_docker.sh`` script at
``isaac_arena/docker/run_docker.sh``.

Remote policies and GR00T
-------------------------

Remote policy workflows (for example the GR1 Open Microwave Door Task)
are split into two containers:

- The **Base** Isaac Lab Arena container, started via
  ``docker/run_docker.sh``. This container does not need to install
  GR00T when you run policies in remote mode.
- A separate **GR00T policy server** container, started via
  ``docker/run_gr00t_server.sh``, which builds an image from
  ``docker/Dockerfile.gr00t_server`` and runs the remote policy server
  entrypoint.

A typical workflow is:

1. Start the Base container for simulation and evaluation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      bash docker/run_docker.sh

2. In a second terminal, start the GR00T policy server container:

   .. code-block:: bash

      bash docker/run_gr00t_server.sh \
        --host 127.0.0.1  \
        --port 5555 \
        --policy_type isaaclab_arena_gr00t.policy.gr00t_remote_policy.Gr00tRemoteServerSidePolicy \
        --policy_config_yaml_path isaaclab_arena_gr00t/policy/config/gr1_manip_gr00t_closedloop_config.yaml

3. Inside the Base container, run the evaluation script with a
   client-side remote policy (see the static manipulation example
   workflow for full command lines).

This setup cleanly separates the Isaac Lab Arena simulation environment
from the GR00T policy server environment. The Base container focuses on
running environments and evaluation logic, while the GR00T server
container is responsible only for hosting the GR00T model and its
dependencies.

If you want to host other policy models as remote servers, you can
follow the same pattern: create a dedicated server Dockerfile and
launcher script (similar to ``docker/Dockerfile.gr00t_server`` and
``docker/run_gr00t_server.sh``), and point it to a custom
``ServerSidePolicy`` implementation as described in
:doc:`../concepts/concept_remote_policies_design`.
